/*
 * Author:  Kevin Imlay
 * Date:  September, 2023
 *
 * Purpose:
 *		The desktop application communication session is intended to manage
 *	the more complex behaviors for communicating with the desktop application.
 *	It builds on top of the UART transport layer, implementing software flow
 *	control, handshaking to start and stop sessions, and receiving/sending
 *	messages with the desktop application.  The use of sessions also helps
 *	minimize resource usage by the MCU while the desktop application is not
 *	connected, conserving power.
 *		Sessions follow a design pattern that updates the session's state with
 *	the use of an update function, allowing the main application (MCU) to
 *	perform this update as often as it chooses.  Updating the state will send
 *	any queued messages and receive messages from the desktop application.
 *	Messages can be queued for transmission outside the update loop, acting as
 *	a buffer that is flushed only when explicitly commanded to by the update
 *	function.  Messages can be dequeued after reception when chosen to by the
 *	main application (MCU).
 *		Sessions are also opened by the desktop application, but can be closed
 *	by either the desktop application or the MCU.
 *		Actions (transmissions, receptions, handshakes) are performed using
 *	polling with timeouts (through the UART transmission layer) to ensure non-
 *	blocking and deterministic behavior.
 *
 *
 *	Note:  In place of a proper queue for message reception and transmission,
 *	the transport layer buffer is used.  This is a point for future development.
